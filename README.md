# Smart Home Device Usage Forecasting with Linear Regression  

This exercise centers on forecasting the usage of smart home devices using a linear regression model that examines past data related to various device interactions and user behaviors. The objective of the model is to assess the efficiency and usage trends of smart home systems. This analysis will aid in recognizing patterns and providing data-driven recommendations for enhancing smart home products to optimize energy performance.  

# Prediction of Earthquakes in Afghanistan from 1995 to 2023 Using Logistic Regression
  
The goal of this task is to categorize whether an earthquake in Afghanistan from 1995 to 2023 is likely to trigger a tsunami. Logistic regression evaluates numerous seismic parameters, including magnitude, depth, and location, to forecast two potential outcomes: whether a tsunami will occur or not. This model assists in identifying critical factors that affect tsunami events and bolsters disaster preparedness initiatives.
